# Digitized Latin Collection

## Summary

This repository, titled the Digitized Latin Collection (DLC), contains a set of Latin texts which were digitized at the University of Notre Dame. 
These works span authors from the Classical, Late, and Medieval periods of Latin, 
and they were digitized in pursuit of questions about prosody across the eras of Latin. 

We created these digitized texts through the following process:
1. We retrieved PDF versions of each text that we digitized, 
and we ensured that we had the rights to use and release data from the given textual editions.
2. We split each PDF into PNGs using `pdf2image` library (available [here](https://github.com/Belval/pdf2image)).
3. We employed the [Tesseract OCR](https://github.com/tesseract-ocr/tesseract) tool with training data (tessdata) for Latin and Ancient Greek.
4. We outputted results to hOCR files, and we uploaded these to a locally-hosted version of the 
Lace post-correction tool (available [here](https://github.com/brobertson/Lace2)).
5. We post-corrected the OCR results in Lace for the *main text* (and not notes or critical apparati), and we obtained EpiDoc-styled XML documents from Lace with our corrections.
6. We ran an additional Latin spellchecker and performed a few manual checks to root out extraneous text such as marginal numbers and catch any missed errors.

Through this process, we created the documents presented in this repository. 
This repository is meant to be a public front-end for the outputs of our correction procedure. 
Other stages of the correction process, as well as code for the various stages of our process above, are available in other repositories.
