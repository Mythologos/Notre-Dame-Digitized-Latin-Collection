# Notre Dame Digitized Latin Collection

## Summary

This repository, titled the Notre Dame Digitized Latin Collection (ND-DLC), contains a set of Latin texts which were digitized at the University of Notre Dame. 
These works span authors from the Classical, Late, and Medieval periods of Latin, 
and they were digitized in pursuit of questions about prosody across the eras of Latin. 

We created these digitized texts through the following process:
1. We retrieved PDF versions of each text that we digitized, 
and we ensured that we had the rights to use and release data from the given textual editions.
2. We split each PDF into PNGs using `pdf2image` library (available [here](https://github.com/Belval/pdf2image)).
3. We employed the [Tesseract OCR](https://github.com/tesseract-ocr/tesseract) tool with training data (tessdata) for Latin and Ancient Greek via the `pytesseract` library (available [here](https://github.com/madmaze/pytesseract)).
4. We outputted results to hOCR files, and we uploaded these to a locally-hosted version of the 
*Lace* post-correction tool (available [here](https://github.com/brobertson/Lace2)).
5. We post-corrected the OCR results in Lace for the *main text* (and not notes or critical apparati), and we obtained EpiDoc-styled XML documents from Lace with our corrections.
6. We ran an additional Latin spellchecker and performed a few manual checks to root out extraneous text such as marginal numbers and catch any missed errors.
7. We applied the [Hook](https://github.com/Capitains/HookTest) testing suite via its [Docker container](https://github.com/Capitains/docker-hooktest) to ensure our documents were EpiDoc- and CTS-compliant, and we altered our documents until all tests passed.

Through this process, we created the documents presented in this repository. 
This repository is meant to be a public front-end for the outputs of our correction procedure. 
Other stages of the correction process, as well as code for the various stages of our process above, are available in other repositories.

### Use

We sourced the PDFs to construct our digital editions from the [Austrian Academy of Sciences Press](https://www.oeaw.ac.at/en/forschung/verlag/austrian-academy-of-sciences-press) and [Hathitrust](https://www.hathitrust.org/). 
We provide metadata in and accompanying each digital edition, following the CapiTainS implementation of the Canonical Text Services (CTS), to cite each source PDF.
- The Austrian Academy of Sciences Press has kindly granted us permission to release data based on their PDFs.
- All Hathitrust PDFs that we used are in the public domain in the United States. 
In addition, Schmitt's edition of Palladius' *Opus Agriculturae* is in the public domain internationally. 
All texts were digitized by Google, but this has no bearing on the release of texts here, as we do not redistribute the images or OCR from their PDFs.
We also did not make use of their OCR in our digitization procedure.

We release all our digital editions under a [Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike 4.0 International license](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/).
